## THE BETTER MINISTRY, COVENANT, AND PROMISES
<div>
<p>
<img alt src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/Hebrews-teaser.jpg" style="border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;">
    <span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);"><i>"<sup>1</sup>Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We have such a high priest, one who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,  <sup>2</sup>a minister in the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that the Lord, not man, set up.  <sup>3</sup>For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. So this one too had to have something to offer.  <sup>4</sup>Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law.  <sup>5</sup>The place where they serve is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary, just as Moses was warned by God as he was about to complete the tabernacle. For he says,  <sup>6</sup>But now Jesus has obtained a <strong>superior ministry, since the covenant that he mediates is also better and is enacted on better promises</strong>.</i></span> (Hebrews 8:1-6)
    </p>
</div>

Verse 6 underscores the supremacy of Jesus in every aspect. His ministry, covenant, and promises all surpass what came before.

In the old covenant, promises of blessings were tied to adherence to commandments, focusing on earthly benefits. In contrast, the new covenant assures eternal life for those who have faith in God's Son. This results in the believer's salvation being secure.

However, Jesus' ministry differs significantly from that of the earthly priests under the old covenant. He serves in the true tabernacle established by God in heaven, where He functions as the exclusive high priest. Given that Jesus now ministers in this heavenly sanctuary, it raises the question of the role of earthly temples. They become outdated and no longer serve a purpose.

## NEW COVENANT

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>7</sup>For <strong>if that first covenant had been faultless</strong>, no one would have looked for a second one.  <sup>8</sup>But showing its fault, God says to them, “LOOK, THE DAYS ARE COMING, SAYS THE LORD, WHEN I WILL COMPLETE A NEW COVENANT WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND WITH THE HOUSE OF JUDAH.  <SUP>9</SUP>“<strong>IT WILL NOT BE LIKE THE COVENANT THAT I MADE WITH THEIR FATHERS</strong>, ON THE DAY WHEN I TOOK THEM BY THE HAND TO LEAD THEM OUT OF EGYPT, BECAUSE THEY DID NOT CONTINUE IN MY COVENANT AND I HAD NO REGARD FOR THEM, SAYS THE LORD.  <SUP>10</SUP>“FOR <strong>THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL ESTABLISH</strong> WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD. I WILL PUT MY LAWS IN THEIR MINDS AND I WILL INSCRIBE THEM ON THEIR HEARTS. AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD AND THEY WILL BE MY PEOPLE.  <SUP>11</SUP>“AND <strong>THERE WILL BE NO NEED AT ALL FOR EACH ONE TO TEACH HIS COUNTRYMAN OR EACH ONE TO TEACH HIS BROTHER</strong> SAYING, ‘KNOW THE LORD,’ SINCE THEY WILL ALL KNOW ME, FROM THE LEAST TO THE GREATEST.  <SUP>12</SUP>“FOR I WILL BE MERCIFUL TOWARD THEIR EVIL DEEDS, AND <strong>THEIR SINS I WILL REMEMBER NO LONGER</strong>.”"</i></span> (Hebrews 8:7-12)

In what way is the old covenant considered flawed? Its fault lies in the fact that it cannot lead anyone to attain eternal life. Was it a mistake on God's part, or did we misinterpret its purpose? Given that we understand that God is incapable of making mistakes, the issue must be with our assumption that the old covenant can facilitate our closeness to God.

The new covenant introduced by God differs from the old one in that, instead of the externally written law on stone tablets, He will inscribe it on their hearts and minds. Rather than relying on an external law taught by others, the Holy Spirit Himself will empower them to both desire and carry out His will.

Even more remarkable, the new covenant will no longer involve dealing with sins, for it declares, "***I WILL NO LONGER REMEMBER THEIR SINS.***"



## OLD COVENANT OBSOLETE

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>13</sup>When he speaks of a new covenant, he makes <strong>the first obsolete</strong>. Now what is growing <strong>obsolete</strong> and aging is about to <strong>disappear</strong>."</i></span> (Hebrews 7:12)

The old covenant becomes obsolete only in the context of believers who have already made the transition to the new covenant. However, the old covenant retains its significance in convicting sinners and guiding them toward Christ.
