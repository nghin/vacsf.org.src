<sup>1</sup>Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, partners in a heavenly calling, take note of Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess, <sup>2</sup>who is faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses was also in God’s house. <sup>3</sup>For he has come to deserve <strong>greater glory than Moses</strong>, just as the builder of a house deserves greater honor than the house itself! <sup>4</sup>For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. <sup>5</sup>Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant, to testify to the things that would be spoken. <sup>6</sup>But Christ is faithful as a son over God’s house. We are of his house, if in fact we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope we take pride in. 
<strong>A REST FOR THE PEOPLE OF GOD</strong><br />
<sup>7</sup>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, “Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks!  <sup>8</sup>“Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of testing in the wilderness. <sup>9</sup>“There your fathers tested me and tried me, and they saw my works for forty years. 
<sup>10</sup>“Therefore, I became provoked at that generation and said, ‘Their hearts are always wandering and <strong>they have not known my ways</strong>.’ <sup>11</sup>“As I swore in my anger, ‘<strong>They will never enter my rest!</strong>’” <sup>12</sup>See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has an <strong>evil, unbelieving heart</strong> that forsakes the living God. <sup>13</sup>But exhort one another each day, as long as it is called “Today,” that none of you may become hardened by sin’s deception. <sup>14</sup>For we have become partners with Christ, if in fact we hold our initial confidence firm until the end. <sup>15</sup>As it says, “Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks! Do not <strong>harden your hearts</strong> as in the rebellion.” <sup>16</sup>For which ones heard and rebelled? Was it not all who came out of Egypt under Moses’ leadership? <sup>17</sup>And against whom was God provoked for forty years? Was it not those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness? <sup>18</sup>And to whom did he swear they would never enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient? <sup>19</sup>So we see that <strong>they could not enter because of unbelief</strong>. </i></span> (Hebrews 3:1-19)</p>

## JESUS GREATER THAN MOSES

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>3</sup>For he has come to deserve <strong>greater glory than Moses</strong>, just as the builder of a house deserves greater honor than the house itself! ... <sup>5</sup>Now <strong>Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant</strong>, to testify to the things that would be spoken. <sup>6</sup>But <strong>Christ is faithful as a son over God’s house</strong>. We are of his house, if in fact we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope we take pride in."</i></span> (Hebrews 3:3,5-6)

There are at least 3 instances in the Bible where Jesus is compared with Moses.

The first instance involves Jesus' transfiguration as recorded in Matthew 17:1-8, Mark 9:2-8, and Luke 9:28-36.  This event is seen as a connection between the Law (Moses) and the Prophets (Elijah) with Jesus, signifying His fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets. The question we should ask ourselves is if Jesus fulfilled it then what is there for us to do except to believe in him?

The second instance involves John 1:17 (NIV): ***"For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."*** This verse highlights the contrast between the law given by Moses and the grace and truth brought by Jesus.

The third instance involves Hebrews 3:1-6. In the book of Hebrews, Moses and Jesus are compared regarding their roles as leaders. Moses is considered faithful as a servant in God's house, but Jesus is considered faithful as a son over God's house, signifying His greater authority.

When we draw a comparison between Jesus and Moses, we inevitably find ourselves evaluating the New Covenant in contrast to the Old Covenant, given that the New Covenant was instituted to supersede the Old. The Old Covenant merely serves as a precursor to the forthcoming salvation, offering life through grace and faith, much like a shadow of what is to come.

## GOD'S REST

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>10</sup>“Therefore, I became provoked at that generation and said, ‘Their hearts are always wandering and <strong>they have not known my ways</strong>.’ <sup>11</sup>“As I swore in my anger, ‘<strong>They will never enter my rest!</strong>’” <sup>12</sup>See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has an <strong>evil, unbelieving heart</strong> that forsakes the living God. ... <sup>15</sup>As it says, “Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks! Do not <strong>harden your hearts</strong> as in the rebellion.” ... <sup>18</sup>And to whom did he swear they would never enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient? <sup>19</sup>So we see that <strong>they could not enter because of unbelief</strong>."</i></span> (Hebrews 3:10-12,15,18-19)

The concept of God's rest in this passage represents the Promised Land situated to the west of the Jordan River. In a manner akin to the Israelites who should have heeded the counsel of Joshua and Caleb to enter the Promised Land, they, unfortunately, succumbed to disbelief.

Hence, it is imperative for us to take heed of the admonition, emphasizing our need to understand God's way, particularly the new and living way. Under the New Covenant, God's way is the way of faith in what Jesus achieved on the cross.
