    <span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);"><i>"<sup>1</sup>Therefore we must be wary that, while the promise of <strong>entering his rest</strong> remains open, none of you may seem to have <strong>come short of it</strong>. <sup>2</sup>For we had good news proclaimed to us just as they did. But <strong>the message they heard did them no good</strong>, since they did not join in with those who <strong>heard it in faith</strong>. <sup>3</sup>For <strong>we who have believed enter that rest</strong>, as he has said, “As I swore in my anger, ‘<strong>They will never enter my rest!</strong>’” And yet God’s works were accomplished from the foundation of the world. <sup>4</sup>For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,” <sup>5</sup>but to repeat the text cited earlier: “They will never enter my rest!” <sup>6</sup>Therefore it remains for some to enter it, yet those to whom it was previously proclaimed did not enter because of <strong>disobedience</strong>. <sup>7</sup>So God again ordains a certain day, “<strong>Today</strong>,” speaking through David after so long a time, as in the words quoted before, “Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks! Do not harden your hearts.” <sup>8</sup>For <strong>if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken afterward about another day</strong>. <sup>9</sup>Consequently a Sabbath rest remains for the people of God. <sup>10</sup>For <strong>the one who enters God’s rest has also rested from his works</strong>, just as God did from his own works. <sup>11</sup>Thus we must <strong>make every effort to enter that rest</strong>, so that no one may fall by following the same pattern of <strong>disobedience</strong>. <sup>12</sup>For <strong>the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing even to the point of dividing soul from spirit, and joints from marrow; it is able to judge the desires and thoughts of the heart</strong>. <sup>13</sup>And no creature is hidden from God, but everything is naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must render an account. <br /><strong>JESUS THE GREAT HIGH PRIEST</strong><br /><sup>14</sup>Therefore since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. <sup>15</sup>For we do not have a high priest incapable of sympathizing with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet without sin. <sup>16</sup>Therefore let us <strong>confidently approach the throne of grace</strong> to receive mercy and find grace whenever we need help.</i></span> (Hebrews 4:1-16)

## HEARING IN FAITH

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>2</sup>For we had good news proclaimed to us just as they did. But <strong>the message they heard did them no good</strong>, since they did not join in with those who <strong>heard it in faith</strong>. <sup>3</sup>For <strong>we who have believed enter that rest</strong>, as he has said, “As I swore in my anger, ‘<strong>They will never enter my rest!</strong>’”"</i></span> (Hebrews 4:2-3)

The Israelites were given a proclamation by Joshua and Caleb, assuring them of the readiness of the Promised Land to welcome them. However, this message proved futile for them because they received it with their ears but did not truly embrace it with faith in their hearts. Instead, they placed their trust in the ten other spies who cautioned them about the presence of giants in the land. These giants symbolized their own sins, their most formidable adversaries.

## DISOBEDIENCE

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>6</sup>Therefore it remains for some to enter it, yet those to whom it was previously proclaimed did not enter because of <strong>disobedience</strong>."</i></span> (Hebrews 4:6)

Is this act of disobedience a violation of the commandments? No, based on the context presented in this chapter, it is a sin of failing to have faith in the testimony of Joshua and Caleb, who affirmed that the land was abundant with milk and honey and should be entered.

## TODAY

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>7</sup>So God again ordains a certain day, “<strong>Today</strong>,” speaking through David after so long a time, as in the words quoted before, “Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks! Do not harden your hearts.” <sup>8</sup>For <strong>if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken afterward about another day</strong>."</i></span> (Hebrews 4:7-8)

Therefore, ***"today,"*** God is extending a fresh call to embrace salvation through grace and faith. The declaration delivered by Joshua and Caleb, urging the people to enter the Promised Land, served as a prelude to the message being proclaimed today, inviting people to find God's rest by placing their faith in Christ. Even today, many individuals persist in confronting their ***"giants"*** through the law instead of finding solace in the completed work of Christ.

## RESTED FROM WORKS

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>9</sup>Consequently a Sabbath rest remains for the people of God. <sup>10</sup>For <strong>the one who enters God’s rest has also rested from his works</strong>, just as God did from his own works. <sup>11</sup>Thus we must <strong>make every effort to enter that rest</strong>, so that no one may fall by following the same pattern of <strong>disobedience</strong>."</i></span> (Hebrews 4:9-11)

God provided us with an illustration of His rest, following His act of creation, through the establishment of the Sabbath rest. Nevertheless, this rest merely serves as a precursor to the genuine rest that can only be attained through faith in Christ. Therefore, anyone who enters into God's rest must also have ***"rested from his works."***

Now, you may wonder, what are these works? They are the works of compliance with the law in order to fulfill God's righteous demands. To continue in these works and not to cease from them is regarded as an act of ***"disobedience."***

## THE SHARP WORD OF GOD

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>12</sup>For <strong>the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing even to the point of dividing soul from spirit, and joints from marrow; it is able to judge the desires and thoughts of the heart</strong>. <sup>13</sup>And no creature is hidden from God, but everything is naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must render an account."</i></span> (Hebrews 4:12-13)

The Word of God possesses such precision that it can discern whether you are following the path of the law or embracing the path of faith.

## JESUS THE GREAT HIGH PRIEST

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>14</sup>Therefore since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. <sup>15</sup>For we do not have a high priest incapable of sympathizing with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet without sin. <sup>16</sup>Therefore let us <strong>confidently approach the throne of grace</strong> to receive mercy and find grace whenever we need help."</i></span> (Hebrews 4:14-16)

Your confidence in approaching the throne of grace rests upon the certainty that all your sins, whether they belong to the past, the present, or the future, have been pardoned. In simpler terms, at the cross, all your formidable challenges, which are your sins, were forgiven. Since ***"we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God."***
