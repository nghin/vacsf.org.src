## A DIFFERENT PRIEST

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>6</sup>as also in another place God says, “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”"</i></span> (Hebrews 5:6)

The Levitical priesthood was a hereditary priesthood established in ancient Israel, specifically among the tribe of Levi, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The high priest, often from the family of Aaron, held a significant position within the Levitical priesthood. He had special responsibilities, including entering the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle or Temple once a year to make atonement for the sins of the people.

Nevertheless, the priesthood of Jesus Christ stands apart. God proclaims regarding Him: ***"You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."*** This is a priesthood that knows no commencement or conclusion, where the supreme high priest offers Himself as a sacrifice without the need for sin offerings on His behalf because He is the flawless Lamb of God, entirely without sin.

## JESUS' OBEDIENCE THROUGH SUFFERING

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>8</sup>Although he was a son, he learned obedience through the things he suffered."</i></span> (Hebrews 5:8)

In everything that Jesus accomplishes, He acts on our behalf. He does so in His capacity as both God and fully human, and He does so flawlessly. Because Jesus is devoid of a sinful nature, He is not bound by the law, which means His obedience differs from that of fallen humanity. His most significant act of obedience is to endure the cross for the redemption of mankind's sins. 

## OUR OBEDIENCE

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>9</sup>And by being perfected in this way, he became the <strong>source of eternal salvation to all who obey him</strong>,"</i></span> (Hebrews 5:9)

So, how can we obey Jesus in order to attain ***"eternal salvation"***? As discussed earlier in chapter 4, we understand that the obedience sought by God from the Israelites is their faithful obedience to the testimony of Joshua and Caleb regarding the bountiful nature of the Promised Land, filled with milk and honey, waiting to welcome them.

Hence, our obedience today is centered on belief, on placing our trust in what Jesus accomplished on the cross for us. While Jesus's obedience involved offering Himself on the cross, our obedience entails accepting this priceless gift of life by ***"faithfully listening"*** to God's message of salvation (Hebrews 4:2).

## MILK vs. SOLID FOOD - OLD vs. NEW COVENANT

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>12</sup>For though you should in fact be teachers by this time, you need someone to teach you the beginning elements of God’s utterances. You have gone back to needing milk, not solid food. <sup>13</sup>For everyone who lives on milk is inexperienced in the message of righteousness, because he is an infant. <sup>14</sup>But solid food is for the mature, whose perceptions are trained by practice to discern both <strong>good and evil</strong>."</i></span> (Hebrews 5:12-14)

Many Christians often possess a limited understanding of the distinction between "milk" and "solid food" in this passage. Perhaps verse 13 may shed light on the meaning of *"milk"*, as it states: ***"For everyone who lives on milk is inexperienced in the message of righteousness."*** Notably, Paul's epistles primarily focus on conveying the message of righteousness.

Therefore, individuals who lack familiarity with the message of righteousness may struggle to grasp how to attain God's righteousness. A central theme in Paul's writings is the juxtaposition of righteousness achieved through obedience to the law and righteousness obtained through faith.

Considering the context of Paul's writing, it becomes evident that those who are guided by the law as their tutor are nourished with milk, whereas those who rely on faith in Christ for righteousness are truly partaking of solid food.

Consequently, those who continue to partake of milk are still dwelling within the confines of the Old Covenant, whereas those who consume solid food have made a complete transition to the New Covenant. In this context, discerning ***"good and evil"*** also entails the ability to distinguish the various methods for achieving God's righteousness: works of the law or faith in Christ.
