You crowned him with glory and honor. <sup>8</sup>You put all things under his control.”</strong> For when he put <strong>all things under his control</strong>, he left nothing outside of his control. At present we do not yet see <strong>all things under his control</strong>, <sup>9</sup>but we see Jesus, who was made <strong>lower than the angels for a little while</strong>, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by God’s grace he would experience death on behalf of everyone. <sup>10</sup>For it was fitting for him, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings. <sup>11</sup>For indeed he who makes holy and those being made holy all have <strong>the same origin</strong>, and so he is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters, <sup>12</sup>saying, “I will proclaim your name to my brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will praise you.” <sup>13</sup>Again he says, “I will be confident in him,” and again, <strong>“Here I am, with the children God has given me.”</strong> <sup>14</sup>Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, <strong>he likewise shared in their humanity, so that through death he could destroy the one who holds the power of death</strong> (that is, the devil), <sup>15</sup>and set free those who were held in slavery all their lives by their fear of death. <sup>16</sup>For surely his concern is not for angels, but he is concerned for Abraham’s descendants. <sup>17</sup><strong>Therefore he had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every respect</strong>, so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people. <sup>18</sup>For since he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted. </i></span> (Hebrews 2:1-18)</p>

## PAY CLOSER ATTENTION

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>1</sup>Therefore we must pay closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not <strong>drift away</strong>. <sup>2</sup>For if the <strong>message</strong> spoken through angels proved to be so firm that every violation or disobedience received its just penalty, <sup>3</sup>how will we escape if we <strong>neglect such a great salvation</strong>? It was first communicated through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him, <sup>4</sup>while God confirmed their witness with signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will. <sup>5</sup>For he did not put <strong>the world to come</strong>, about which we are speaking, <strong>under the control of angels</strong>."</i></span> (Hebrews 2:1-5)

While angels, signs, wonders, and miracles are referenced in this passage, the primary focus lies on two central themes: salvation and the message itself. The signs, wonders, and miracles serve as a means to underscore the significance of the message.

The core purpose of the message is to highlight the profound salvation we should be more attentive to. Although God employed angels as messengers, it's essential to recognize that these angels do not have authority over <i><strong>"the world to come,"</strong></i> which is synonymous with our salvation.

As we progress through the book of Hebrews, it becomes evident that the revelation of the message regarding salvation will take center stage. In this context, we will gain a deeper understanding of what the Hebrews might be ***"drifting away from"*** or how they might be ***"neglecting such a great salvation."*** One thing that can be assured is that they are not straying from the teachings of the Mosaic law or seeking salvation through strict adherence to the law.

## ALL THINGS UNDER HIS CONTROL

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>6</sup>Instead someone testified somewhere: “What is man that you think of him or the son of man that you care for him? <sup>7</sup>You made him lower than the angels for a little while. You crowned him with glory and honor. <sup>8</sup><strong>You put all things under his control.”</strong>"</i></span> (Hebrews 2:6-8)

It is evident that he wields authority over all things, as he is the architect of the cosmos. As Colossians 1:16-17 affirms, <i>"<sup>16</sup>For all things in heaven and on earth were created in him – all things, whether visible or invisible, whether thrones or dominions, whether principalities or powers – all things were created through him and for him. <sup>17</sup>He himself is before all things and all things are held together in him."</i> (Colossians 1:16-17)

Nonetheless, the paramount focus is not on his rule over creation, angels, or demons, but rather on his redemptive plan. His pronouncements on the salvation of sinners are absolute. How do you envision your path to salvation? In the book of Hebrews, you'll have the opportunity to realign your comprehension of the gospel.

## JESUS SHARES IN OUR HUMANITY

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>11</sup>For indeed he who makes holy and those being made holy all have <strong>the same origin</strong>, ... <sup>14</sup>Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, <strong>he likewise shared in their humanity, ... <sup>17</sup>Therefore he had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every respect</strong>, so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people. <sup>18</sup>For since he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted."</i></span> (Hebrews 2:11,14,17-18)

With the exception of a sinful nature, Jesus is essentially identical to us in every aspect, fully participating in our flesh and blood, sharing in our humanity. This means that he can experience every emotion that humans are capable of feeling, including our sorrow, pain, and yearning, encompassing all our negative emotions.

However, I've observed that certain Christian belief systems tend to reject or downplay negative emotions. They may enthusiastically join in celebrating your joys with hallelujahs but may not stand by your side during your moments of distress or empathize with your pain. If you were to examine their language, you'd find it predominantly composed of positive words. If you're grappling with an illness and their prayers don't bring healing, don't anticipate their presence to offer comfort during your period of hardship.
