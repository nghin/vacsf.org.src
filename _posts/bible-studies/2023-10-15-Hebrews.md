##  [<u>Hebrews 1:1-14</u>]({{ site.url }}{% post_url bible-studies/Hebrews/2023-10-15-Hebrews-01-v01-14 %})

Hebrews 1 emphasizes the superiority of Jesus Christ over the angels. It affirms that God has spoken to humanity through His Son, who is the heir of all things and the Creator of the universe. Jesus is depicted as the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His nature. In this way, Hebrews 1 introduces the central theme of the book, which is the supremacy of Jesus and the New Covenant.
