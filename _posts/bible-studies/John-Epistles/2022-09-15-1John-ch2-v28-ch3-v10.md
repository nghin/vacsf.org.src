In today's study of 1 John 2:7-27, you will read the Apostle John's extensive exhortation on love, particularly how it is framed in a commandment. When you read his teaching, remember to read it not for others, but for yourself, with the intent to experience it firsthand. There is no point in attempting to teach others unless you are confident that you can meet its highest expectations. I'm afraid I'm writing more to ask questions than to provide answers. But my inquiries are sincere, and I am confident that the Holy Spirit will lead me to the truth.

## THE OLD COMMANDMENT

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
*“<sup>7</sup>Dear friends, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an **old commandment** which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have already heard."*
</span>
(1 John 2:7)

Subsequently, John let us know what the commandment is in verse 9:

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
*“<sup>9</sup>The one who says he is in the light but still hates his fellow Christian is still in the darkness. <sup>10</sup>The one who loves his fellow Christian resides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him. <sup>11</sup>But the one who hates his fellow Christian is in the darkness, walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.”*
</span>
(1 John 2:9-11)

I’m assuming this is what John remembered Jesus say when he was still on earth:

> <span style="color: rgb(0, 61, 152);">
*“ ‘<sup>37</sup>Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ <sup>38</sup>This is the first and greatest commandment. <sup>39</sup>And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’  <sup>40</sup>All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”*</span> (Matthew 22:37-40)

We know that Jesus gave this new commandment, which is actually an old commandment phrased differently, to combine all of God's commandments, including the Ten Commandments, in order to demolish mankind's expectations of achieving God's righteousness through obedience. Jesus use this commandment to point those who lived under the law toward the cross where he ushers in the New Covenant. John wanted to hold them back, or he's using the commandment as a continuation of the old system.

What do you think John's *"old commandment"* will achieve? If he believes that using the law will inspire good behavior, he is gravely mistaken, because:

> <span style="color: rgb(0, 61, 152);">
*“<sup>8</sup>But sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of wrong desires. For apart from the law, sin is dead. <sup>9</sup>And I was once alive apart from the law, but <u>with the coming of the commandment sin became alive <sup>10</sup>and I died</u>.”*</span> (Romans 7:8-10)

John intended to use the law through the commandments to produce love, but the above verse indicates that *"wrong desires"* will be produced instead. As opposed to love, wrong desires can include hatred and jealousy.

## DEFINITION OF LOVE

Below is the definition of love according to the Greek Dictionary. Love is ἀγαπάω in Greek:

> <span style="color: rgb(0, 61, 152);">
***G25 - ἀγαπάω – agapaō - ag-ap-ah'-o**<br />
Perhaps from ἄγαν agan (much; or compare [H5689]); to love (in a social or moral sense): - (be-) love (-ed).*
</span>

***agapaō*** is the highest kind of love, and it was this term that Jesus used twice to question the apostle Peter: <i>"Peter, do you love - ***agapaō*** - me?"</i>, and both times his answer was that he could only ***philéo*** Jesus, a type of friendship love that is not of the same quality as ***agapaō***. How can John expect believers to do what Peter refused to do with that definition?  My reaction to John's *"old commandment"* should be self-evident. Note that the verb used in John's old commandment is ***agapaō***.

## IN CONCLUSION

The remainder of chapter 2 just contains general teaching on Christian living, so I'll leave it to the individuals to study on their own. Each person can rely on the Holy Spirit's guidance to live in accordance with their unique circumstances and experiences.

One thing we must keep reiterating is that we cannot please God or maintain our relationship with him by relying on the law in any form. This is the fundamental and most crucial feature of the NEW COVENANT. We must recognize that we are easily tempted to return to the law. If obeying the law does not bring us salvation, it will not help us live out our Christian lives, as shown in Romans 7:8-10. Instead of looking to Jesus, who is the author and finisher of our faith, law-based teaching tends to make us look to ourselves to try to achieve what Jesus had to die on the cross to do for us.

I'm afraid John, or whoever wrote this letter, did not completely grasp the significance of the New Covenant gospel.
