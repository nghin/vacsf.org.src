## PROGRESSIVE SANCTIFICATION

Though we have already discussed verse 22 of Chapter 1, I believe there is one more important aspect of this verse that we should discuss this Sunday. Let's go over this verse again: <span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);"><i>"... but now he has reconciled you by his physical body through death to present you <strong>holy, without blemish, and blameless</strong> before him."</i></span>
</p>
</div>

There is a concept called "progressive sanctification" that is almost universally accepted by Christians. Let's survey a few of their definitions:

> Progressive sanctification is what gradually separates the people of God from the world and makes them more and more like Jesus Christ. (gotquestions.org)<br />
> Progressive sanctification is a process by which the Spirit produces in believers a gradual increase likeness to Christ. It is a life long process. (preceptaustin.org)

I could quote more, but the main points are the same: "lifelong" and "more and more." I have no problem with the "lifelong" concept because we all have to wait for the Lord's return before we are transformed from glory to glory, but the "more and more" concept bothers me.

How do I gauge my progress toward becoming more like Christ? Are you the one who will certify my progress? Do you know what Christ is like so you can point me in the right direction? Yes, I've become more patient, thoughtful, and slower to anger, and there is undeniably more peace in my soul, but isn't it a little arrogant to say I'm becoming more like Christ? You can form your own opinion about what Christ is like; I have none.

My only knowledge of Christ is what I've learned from the Bible. God gave birth to him through a virgin. He was born sinless. He is God and man at the same time. Whatever he said brought comfort to my heart because I sensed his power, which was unlike anything I had ever heard. He resurrected the dead. He was able to heal the blind and the lame. He died on the cross to atone for my sins. He was the only one who could forgive my sins. His love is unfailing. Man considers their own merit and performance, whereas God considers his free gift of salvation to those who are humble in heart. So, how do you think I, or anyone else, will ever become like him?

We have quickly forgotten the lesson learned in the Garden of Eden when man desired to become like God. They gave their lives for such a desire.

Our key verse, Colossians 1:22, demonstrates God's method of restoring our lost glory: Jesus' *"physical body through death."*   Your progressive sanctification is a long way from being presented to God as "*holy, without blemish, and blameless."* Your way of becoming like Christ is through your own efforts, whereas God's way is through the death of His Son.

As a result, I conclude that progressive sanctification theology is a man-made doctrine with no place in the gospel.

## ESTABLISHED AND FIRM IN THE FAITH

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>23</sup>... if indeed you remain in the faith, established and firm, without shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard. This gospel has also been preached in all creation under heaven, and I, Paul, have become its servant.</i></span> (Colossians 1:23)

What believers fear most is that God will find them wanting when Christ returns to receive his bride. That's why they invented progressive sanctification to avoid hearing God speak to them: *"I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity."* (Matthew 7:23) But, thankfully, according to verse 22, we will be presented *"holy, without blemish, and blameless"* through the blood of Christ. It is his free gift to those who believe.

However, there is a catch. You must maintain the *"hope of the gospel that you heard."*  The question is, how do you maintain your position? Many people believe that by continuing to do things associated with the faith, such as attending church, tithing, evangelism, prayer, fasting, and so on. Don't misunderstand me. These things are fine, but you must be careful not to accept them as gospel. They are not the gospel you were taught. Because if you follow this false gospel of works, you will eventually lose faith in God due to repeated and unavoidable failures. Through progressive sanctification, your faith in yourself will demonstrate that you will never be *"holy, without blemish, and blameless"* before God.

The true gospel you heard is simple and it's clearly stated in verse 22: *"he has reconciled you by his physical body through death to present you holy, without blemish, and blameless before him."* It's Jesus' physical body, not you, not any works that can proceed from your flesh no matter how noble they may appear.

Sure you should continue to do good works for God, but don't let them become your gospel, because if you do, you will have proven that you don't hold firm to the gospel you heard. My advice is you grow to understand deeply the gospel you heard, that is *"Christ and him crucified"* (1 Cor 2:2), and the works will be byproducts of your genuine faith. Works that are produced from coercion by the law are dead fruits (Romans 7:5). Be content to wait for the Spirit of God to produce fruit that endure into eternity.
